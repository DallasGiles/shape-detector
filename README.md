Shape Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect and classify simple geometric shapes (e.g., circles, squares, triangles) in images. The model is trained on a synthetic dataset of shapes generated using Python and OpenCV, with data augmentation to improve its generalization capabilities.
